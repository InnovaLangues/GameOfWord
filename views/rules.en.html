<h2 class="text-center">Greetings Wise One, welcome in Game of Words!</h2>
<h4 class="text-center">It’s time to show off your talents!</h4>
	<p class="text-justify">Game of Word offers an asynchronous online avatar of guessing game, reusing game mechanics from ‘Taboo’, created in 1990 by Brian Hersch and Bernard Bougrèle, and published by Hasbro. The purpose of the game is to make other players guess words in a limited time. Be careful, on each card are written forbidden words. Words of the same ‘family’ are also forbidden.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Example of Card :  </h4>
<p class="text-center">« Phone » </p>

<h4 class="text-center">Forbidden words : </h4>
<p class="text-center">Mobile </p>
<p class="text-center">Speak </p>
<p class="text-center">Line </p>
<p class="text-center">Number </p>
<p class="text-center">Ring </p>
<p class="text-center"><strong>In Game of Word you can play three roles</strong>: <strong>Oracle</strong> (the “descriptor”), <strong>Druid</strong> (the “referee”) and <strong>Augur</strong> (or Diviner, the “guesser”) corresponding to the players' moves in the original game. </p>
	<h3><a>Oracle</a></h3>
	<h3>Be an Oracle and state divine prophecy!</h3>
	<h4>If you choose to be an Oracle, you have three choices : </h4>

	<h3><strong>Random Card Description</strong></h3>
	<h4>Read well through the signs, and spread the good news!</h4>
	<p class="text-center">A card will appear to you, randomly selected. Careful, you cannot describe a card you have created as a Druid. Check if your microphone is correctly working, follow the instructions and let’s go!</p>
	<p class="text-center">Depending on the difficulty you choose, you will have maximum <?php $gh = new GameHandler();echo $gh->oracle_time_to_string("en") ;?> seconds to produce a description of the word given in the card without using the word, the (<?php $gh = new GameHandler();echo $gh->forbid_count_to_string("en") ;?>) forbidden words associated (depending on the level) or apparented words. Keep in mind that your description will be subject to a validation, so there is no interest in cheating (except losing points ;) ). Additional time is given to you so you can listen to your description and delete it.</p>
	<p class="text-center">If you want to start over the recording (but not the timer), you can press <img src="style/default.css/imgs/restart.png"/></p>
	<p class="text-center">You will receive points if your recording is considered valid by a druid, but you will lose some if the druid does not think it follows the rules, so think well! If the Augur cannot guess your word, you will also lose points. But if the augur finds it you will win points.</p>

	<h3><strong>Card by ID Description</strong></h3>
	<h4>A Druid gave you his card, follow this line of inquiry!</h4>

	<h3><strong>Random Card Creation</strong></h3>
	<h4>Well, it surely is nice to read the signs, but what if I do not like what is written?</h4>
	<p class="text-center"><strong>Only works in French</strong>, generate your own card! Clic on the "randomize" button to generate automatically a random card. If this card does not suit you, you can clic on the "refresh" button until it does. You have 20 seconds to make up your mind, estimate the card level of difficulty and clic on "validate" to play with your card.</p>

	<h3><strong>Druid</strong></h3>
	<h4>The reign of order shall come under your druidic power</h4>
	<h4>If you choose to be a Druid, you will have to choose between two paths. </h4>

	<h3><strong>Arbitrate a Game</strong></h3>
	<h4>Thou art Justice, thou art the Night, thou art... a Druid!</h4>
	<p class="text-center"> The right of life and death, held in your hands upon the descriptions of the Oracles! You are the Censor, the Almighty, a forbidden word slipped into a description? Boom! You can take it down. A word of the same family insidiously whispered? Heretic! Burned at the stake! The word to find pronounced by mistake? You shall have no mercy! MOUAHAHA! You will gain points whatever your choice, so be worthy of the trust alloted to your rank. </p>

	<h3><strong>Card Creation</strong></h3>
	<h4>Oracles see you rulin', they hatin'</h4>
	<p class="text-center">What's up with these Oracles? They think they can create card? Tsss! You can do waaaaay better than them! Clic on "create a card" to create a newcard entirely. Add as many forbidden words as you want or suppress them, it is up to you! Do not forget to give an estimation of you card level of difficulty (the score computation depends on that). You can empty the whole card by clicking on "reset". Click on "validate" when you are done. A  preview of you card will appear as well as the id of you card. You can now send this id to your friends and show off saying “THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is a card!”</p>
	<p class="text-center">You'll get points for everycard you create… Indeed, don't forget that you have the power to create cards in any language thus expanding the possibilities of the game!!</p>

	<h3><strong>Augur</strong></h3>
		<h4>The Oracle left you some clues, would you find out the word?</h4>
		<p class="text-center">A word will be randomly selected (given you were neither Oracle, nor Druid for it). Check on you headphones or speaker and a countdown starts. You will get a certain amount of time (based on the level of difficulty) to enter the word to guess in the blank field. Be careful, spelling mistakes will not be accepted (including on diacritics)! you are all supposed to be wise! You can submit as many words as you want during the listening. If you find out the word, you will get points. If you do not, you and the Oracle you have been listening to will lose points. No pressure at all…</p><br/>

		<h3><strong>Scoring</strong></h3>
			<h4>Your growth shall follow complex and intertwined incantations…</h4>
			<p class="text-center">The scoring of the game follows a formula that depends on your level, the level of the card and the difficulty you chose. A basic stake is chosen by you in terms of difficulty and adds certain constraints (more or less forbidden words, more or less time) and is associated to stakes. The more difficult, the more you can earn… and the more you can lose. Then each card has a difficulty, if you play a card difficult considering your level, the risks are low, you will win more if you win and lose less if you lose. With easier cards you are bound to win easy points… but if you lose, you will lose more.</p><br/>
